# React integration

As of version 2.3.0 JSON Forms supports two basic usage patterns: one where the glboal state is stored within redux 
and one without redux. We'll a have a look at both in this section.

## Redux integration

TODO

## JSON Forms as a standalone component

### Background
**NOTE**: You can skip this section if you are not interested why we got rid of redux. 

The motivation for having isolated JSON Forms was having multiple forms generated by JSON Forms on the
same page. With redux this is not so easily possible as there's only a single state that is shared by
all forms. Altough it'd have been possible to adapt the implementation accordingly, a cleaner approach
is to get rid of global state altogehter and have each JSON Forms manage its own state. This eases 
integration of multiple forms and also allows for greater flexibilty, e.g. when you want to use different 
renderers.

### Usage

The `JsonForms` component expects four parameters: `schema`, `uischema`, `data` and `renderers`:

* `schema`: the JSON schema that describes the underlying data
* `uischema`: the UI schema that describes how the form should be rendered. You can generate 
  a UI schema with `Generate.uiSchema` in case you don't have one available
* `data`: The data to be rendered
* `renderers`: The renderers that should be used for rendering the form
