# React Integration

As of version 2.3.0, JSON Forms supports two basic usage patterns: one where the global state is stored within Redux 
and one without Redux. We'll a have a look at both in this section.


## JSON Forms as a standalone component

### Usage

The `JsonForms` component takes the following props:

* `schema`: the JSON schema that describes the underlying data
* `uischema`: the UI schema that describes how the form should be rendered. If none is provided a default layout is used
* `data`: The data to be rendered
* `renderers`: The renderers that should be used for rendering the form
* `cells`: The cells that should be used for rendering the form
* `onChange`: A callback which is called on each data change, containing the updated data and the validation result.
    Please make sure to not create a "data cycle", the updated data doesn't need to be provided back to JSON Forms.
* `config`: The default options element for all ui schema elements

```
<JsonForms
  schema={schema}
  uischema={uischema}
  data={data}
  renderers={materialRenderers}
  cells={materialCells}
  onChange={({ errors, data }) => setData(data)}
/>
```

## Redux integration

<Note 
  title="ATTENTION" 
  body="Deprecated: Please note that we are removing the Redux integration in a future version. To ease migration we recommend using the standalone component."
/>

When using Redux, you need to wrap the entry point with a new component called `JsonFormsReduxContext`. The component used for dispatching is now called `JsonFormsDispatch`.
The typical usage in this case is as follows:

```javascript
<Provider store={store}>
  <JsonFormsReduxContext>
    <JsonFormsDispatch />
  </JsonFormsReduxContext>
</Provider>
```
