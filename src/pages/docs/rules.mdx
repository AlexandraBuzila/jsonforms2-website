# Rules

<ApiLink link={`/public/api/core/interfaces/rule.html`} title='Rules' /> allow for dynamic aspects for a form, e.g. by hiding or disabling UI schema elements.
 
A rule may be attached to any UI schema element and can be defined with the `rule` property.
We'll first look at an example definition of a rule and then explain it in detail.

```javascript
"rule": {
  "effect": "HIDE",
  "condition": {
    "scope": "#/properties/name",
    "schema": { enum: ["foo"] }
  }
}
```

A rule basically works by first evaluating the `condition` property and in case it evaluates
to true, executing the associated `effect`.
 
## RuleEffect
<Typography variant='body1'>
  The <code>effect</code> property determines what should happen to the attached UI schema element once
  the <code>condition</code> is met. In the example above, if the <code>name</code> property has the value
  of <code>foo</code>, we'll hide the UI schema element the rule is attached to.
  Current effects include:
</Typography>

* <code>HIDE</code>: hide the UI schema element
* <code>SHOW</code>: show the UI schema element
* <code>DISABLE</code>: disable the UI schema element
* <code>ENABLE</code>: enable the UI schema element

<div title='condition' type='Condition' link='/api/core/interfaces/condition.html'/>
<Typography variant='body1'>
  The <code>condition</code> property describes what value should be observed and validates that value with
  against the JSON schema that is specified with `schema`. If validation succeeds the condition is fulfilled
  and the associated <code>effect</code> will be triggered.
</Typography>

<Typography variant='body1'>
  <code>SchemaBasedCondition</code>s have been introduced with version
  2.0.6 and have become the new default. The previous format via <code>type</code> and <code>expectedValue</code> properties
  is still supported for the time being.
</Typography>
