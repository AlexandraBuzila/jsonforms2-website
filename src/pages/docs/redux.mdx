## Redux integration

<Note
  title='ATTENTION'
  body='Deprecated: Please note that we are removing the Redux integration in a future version. To ease migration we recommend using the standalone component.'
/>

When using Redux, you need to wrap the entry point with a new component called `JsonFormsReduxContext`. The component used for dispatching is now called `JsonFormsDispatch`.
The typical usage in this case is as follows:

```javascript
<Provider store={store}>
  <JsonFormsReduxContext>
    <JsonFormsDispatch />
  </JsonFormsReduxContext>
</Provider>
```
