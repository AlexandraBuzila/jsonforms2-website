# UI Schema Elements

The UI schema, which is passed to JSON Forms,
describes the general layout of a form and is just a regular JSON object.
It describes the form by means of different UI schema elements, which can often categorized
into either Controls or Layouts.

<Note 
  title="ATTENTION" 
  body="Please note that the UI schema hasn't been finalized yet! We'll try keep changes to a minimum and only do them if it's an substantial improvement to the framework."
/>
