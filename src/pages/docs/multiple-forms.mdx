# Multiple Forms

There are use cases where multiple forms should be embedded into a single page. This section 
describes some of these in more detail.

## Linking forms

Forms can interact with each other by using `$ref` and setting the `scope` property within the UI schema
accordingly. In this example, we have two entities, Person and Address. Whenever we change
the `shippingAddress` property of the person, it is accordingly updated in the address form and vice versa.

<LinkedForms />

## Multiple forms within single store
There might be use cases where you have forms that do not have anything in common. In such cases
you can explicitly pass  `schema` and `uischema` props to the `JsonForms` component
(if you don't specify these, they will be fetched from the store).

Additionally, the `JsonForms` component also takes a `path` prop which specifies
the instance path that is used to bind against the data.

To illustrate, let's look again at the example from before, but this time
the `person` and `address` schemas are not stored in any common parent schema.

<MultipleForms />

The code for the above example looks as follows:

```
<div>
  <JsonForms schema={personSchema}
             uischema={personUISchema}
             path='person'
  />
  <JsonForms schema={addressSchema}
             uischema={addressUISchema}
             path='address'
  />
</div>
```

As you can see we explicitly pass in the `schema` and `uischema` props.
We also need to specify which property the data should be written to, in this case we
use `person` and `shippingAddress`.
